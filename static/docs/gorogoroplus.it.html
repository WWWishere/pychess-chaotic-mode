<p>Gorogoro+ is essentially shogi on a 5x6 board.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>As this game is based off shogi, please see the corresponding guide for basic shogi rules first if you are not familiar with them.</p>
<p>The starting setup is as above. Unlike standard shogi, there is no bishop or rook. There are only kings, pawns, lances, knights and generals. You have knight and lance in hand at the beginning of the game. Promotion is only done in the last two ranks. </p>
