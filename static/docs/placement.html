<p>Pal Benko credited the idea of “Pre-Chess” or “Shuffle-Chess” to David Bronstein.</p>
<p>Different than the “Placement Chess” described on the Chess Variants site, this variant is simply a modification where players take turns placing their back rank pieces. Castling only works when the king and the corresponding rook are in their normal position.</p>
