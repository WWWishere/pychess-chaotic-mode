<p>Manchu chess (Chinese: 满洲棋; pinyin: <em>Mǎnzhōuqí</em>), also known as Yitong or Yitong chess (Chinese: 一统棋; pinyin: <em>Yìtǒngqí</em>), is an asymmetric variant of Xiangqi. It was created during the Qing Dynasty by the Bannermen and was one of the most popular board games among them.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>The board and pieces are almost the same as Xiangqi. The black side is unchanged, while the red side loses all its cannons, horses, and chariots except for a single chariot. That chariot combines the moves of the normal chariot, cannon, and horse. This piece is sometimes referred to as the <em>Banner</em>.</p>

<p>While black is the stronger side, the black player must be careful not to lose pieces too easily to the banner.</p>
