<p>Makpong is a variant of Makruk (Thai chess) designed to reduce draws. It is played in Makruk single elimination tournaments in Thailand to decide a winner after a certain number of Makruk games have been drawn.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the rules of Makruk, please see that first.</p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>Pieces, win conditions, and other rules are the same as Makruk.</p>
<p>However, there is one additional rule regarding how the king moves:</p>
<ul>
<li>The king may not move away from check</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify, there are generally three ways to answer a check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the king away</li>
<li>Block the check with another piece</li>
<li>Capture the attacker</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the first option, moving the king away, is <em>not</em> allowed. You can only block the check or capture the attacker.</p>
<ul>
<li>The king is still allowed to capture an unprotected attacker. In this case, the king isn't moving <em>away</em> from the check, so it doesn't break the rule.</li>
<li>Checking the king with multiple pieces is an immediate checkmate. Moving the king to capture either of them is illegal since it involves moving <em>away</em> from the other attacker.</li>
</ul>
